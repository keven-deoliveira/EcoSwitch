# EcoSwitch Circuit

## About the Circuit
The EcoSwitch circuit consists of an ESP32 microcontroller, a DTH22 temperature and humidity sensor, a L298N motor driver, a Nema 17 stepper motor, and a 12V battery pack with 8 AA alkaline batteries. It also includes a 5V regulator, a 10 kÎ© resistor, an 100 nF ceramic capacitor, and a 1uF electrolytic capacitor.
