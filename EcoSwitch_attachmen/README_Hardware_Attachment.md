# EcoSwitch Attachment

## About the Attachemnt
  The Ecoswitch attachemnt is specifically designed to fit on top of an FCU switch located in a brownstone on Boston Universityâ€™s campus. The attachment makes it possible to turn the dial using the motor. The hole at the top of the attachment is fit to the diameter of the motor shaft. Inserting rubber pieces allows for a tighter fit.</p>
